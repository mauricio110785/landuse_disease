The Amazonian region of Peru and Brazil are undergoing large-scale ecological and economic changes. The goal of this project is to understand diseases transition and its spatial-explicit dynamics in the context of the land-use and socio-economic changes in this important frontier region. 
Our team is investigating how these changes connect to the population dynamics of infectious diseases, especially malaria. We aim to develop an integrated model that will combine geospatial and epidemiological simulation with agent-based simulation to represent these complex socio-ecological interactions and feedback. The team is using remote sensing data, epidemiological time series, and socio-economic survey data. 
We are focusing our efforts this week to conceptualize the connection between data and models.




## Data

If the repository does not contain a data folder, [download] a zipped data file to accompany the worksheets. A "good" data-synthesis pipeline stores the data separate from the code&mdash;we may take a shortcut for these lessons.
