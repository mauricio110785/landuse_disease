# README.md

A `README.md` file is a very useful component of any project repository. As you can (or may soon) see, it is automatically rendered on GitHub as a simple "homepage" for your project. Instructions for creating your own GitHub repository from these files may be given during the course. The same instructions are also summarized in [CONTRIBUTING.md].
