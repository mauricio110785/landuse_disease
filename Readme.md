# Synergistic interactions of environmental degradation, socio-economic development and infectious disease dynamics in the Amazon region

## Introduction

The Amazonian region of Peru and Brazil are undergoing large-scale ecological and economic changes. The goal of this project is to understand diseases transition and its spatial-explicit dynamics in the context of the land-use and socio-economic changes in this important frontier region.   

Our team is investigating how these changes connect to the population dynamics of infectious diseases, especially malaria. We aim to develop an integrated model that will combine geospatial and epidemiological simulation with agent-based simulation to represent these complex socio-ecological interactions and feedback. The team is using remote sensing data, epidemiological time series, and socio-economic survey data.   

We are focusing our efforts this week to conceptualize the connection between data and models.

## Data
### Survey data  
- Self-reported malaria in the last 12 months 
- Inquiry about their history of malaria infections  
- Indirect effects of malaria
- Morbidity
- Demographic information from the interviewee and the house mates  
- Records the ownership of objects such as appliances and vehicles  
- Records all the occupations and sources of income of the householders  
- Five blocks collect data on house construction material  
- Accessibility 
- Source of water  
- Garbage disposal   
- Electricity
- Questions on activities and habits associated with malaria exposure and usage of bed nets as well as other mosquito deterrents are in the last blocks  
- Mobility by motivation, frequency and time spent

### Remote Sensing
complete  
### SIVEP data
Malaria cases from 2003 to the present data were obtained from the Epidemiological Surveillance System (SIVEP) of the Ministry of Health, Brazil.
